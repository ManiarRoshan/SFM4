          A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) 
          that are generated by our actions. The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, 
          one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have 
          the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year 
          needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.
